## Authentication

The frontend stores the Cognito ID and refresh tokens in `localStorage` and in
the React context. API requests automatically refresh the ID token if it has
expired using the stored refresh token. This allows users to stay logged in
without reâ€‘entering credentials until the refresh token itself expires.
